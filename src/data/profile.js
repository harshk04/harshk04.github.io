      'Leading the AI/ML vertical at GDG JIIT-128 meant balancing curiosity-driven learners with fast-moving tooling. I started by mapping the community’s baseline—surveying interests, experience levels, and availability—to build cohorts that felt inclusive yet challenging.',
      'We introduced “lab hours” instead of lectures. Members brought their blockers, we debugged together, and everyone left with tangible progress. Pairing these sessions with short lightning talks created a culture of sharing and public speaking.',
      'Another lever was mini shipping challenges. By setting a two-week window, defining success metrics, and encouraging demo days, we saw motivation spike. Teams became accountable to one another, which translated into more complete projects and confident storytelling.',
      'My biggest lesson: communities move at the speed of clarity. When the “why” behind an initiative is obvious and the runway is structured, people show up fully. That mindset now guides every collaboration I lead.',
      'If you are running a community today, document your rituals. We created playbooks for onboarding, project selection, and retros so that new organisers could step in effortlessly. It kept momentum high even during exam seasons.',

      'BookFinder began as a personal frustration: I wanted a faster way to surface quotes and references from dense PDF libraries. Traditional keyword search missed nuance, so I prototyped a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) flow that blended embeddings with lightweight LLM reasoning.',
      'The stack paired a Qdrant vector database with sentence-transformers for embeddings, while GPT-2 handled the response generation for cost efficiency. The architecture hinged on keeping context windows tight—chunking PDFs, ranking snippets by semantic similarity, and feeding only the top candidates into the model.',
      'A key learning was observability. I instrumented the app to log prompt, context, and completions so I could continuously tweak chunk sizes and reranking thresholds. That feedback loop helped balance latency with answer quality.',
      'If you are shipping your own RAG workflow, invest early in evaluation datasets. Being able to benchmark retrieval accuracy and response helpfulness made every iteration grounded in real signal instead of instinct.',
      'I also learned the value of delightful guardrails. Every answer ships with citations, a confidence score, and a quick view of the source snippet so users can trust the output without leaving the interface.',

      'Side projects are my favourite playground for sharpening both product instincts and technical depth. Over time I built a simple framework—Spark, Scope, Ship—that keeps me honest about why a project exists and who it serves.',
      'Spark is all about identifying the tension. I talk to 3–5 people facing the problem, capture their exact words, and distil the pain into a single sentence. If that sentence does not energise me, I move on.',
      'Scope forces me to rank features ruthlessly. I map the core job-to-be-done, list supporting capabilities, and choose the smallest surface that can deliver a “wow” moment. Everything else becomes a backlog item with a hypothesis attached.',
      'Ship means over-investing in storytelling. I polish the README, record a 30-second Loom, and document the architecture. When people can see the thought process, they are more likely to try, share, and contribute.',
      'The meta lesson: your side projects should be mini experiments in empathy. When you make the user feel understood, the technology feels inevitable.',
      'I end every project with a retro: what hypotheses were validated, which tech choices slowed me down, and what I would automate next time. That reflection loop compounds learning faster than any tutorial.',
